# Photato
## Photographer's most needed app

The app is currently in early development. The main functionality of the application is an interactive map with locations for photography marked on it. The user can tap on a marker on the map, and a screen will open with a description of the place, how to get there, sample photos, and more. The user can add places to favorites.

App's design draft in Figma

Photato app will include next technologies stack:
- Clean Swift + TDD
- UIKit
- MapKit
- CloudKit
- Snapkit
- Alamofire
- Dependecy injection

In the future, theoretically, the application can be extended with the ability for the user to leave ratings for each place, leave comments, and also suggest their places for taking photos. In general, the application has room for improvement. But for now let's code.
